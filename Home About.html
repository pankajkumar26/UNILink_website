                The Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) was established in August 2020 by the Government
                of NCT of Delhi to equip students with world-class skill education to enable access to aspirational jobs
                and inculcate entrepreneurial mindset and entrepreneurship. DSEU aims to create a win-win for the youth
                and the industry by filling the existing gaps in skill training.</p>
            <p>
                Building on the education philosophy of thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave, DSEU aims to
                integrate the use of the hand, head, and heart for balanced living and engagement in lifelong learning.
                The focus will be on teaching both self-reliance for life-long independence and the wisdom towards
                nurturing and valuing interdependence. </p>

            <p> 
                The University wishes to change the existing paradigm of skilling, making skill acquisition aspirational
                and providing opportunities to all for skilling, up-skilling and reskilling. Besides, DSEU will support
                and nurture entrepreneurs and provide quality mentorship to steer the entrepreneurial journeys of those
                interested, by providing incubation, and constant support.</p>

                The University has twin objectives-

            <p> To change the existing paradigm of skilling, make skill acquisition aspirational and provide an
                opportunity to all for skilling, up-skilling, and re-skilling.
                Support and nurture entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship
                The University will offer courses to people from all walks of life and empower the marginalized and
                minority groups by providing them with an opportunity to attain world-class education. The University
                aims to develop aware and well-rounded citizens.</p>
            <p>
                The course curriculum offered at DSEU will be inspired by industry requirements and will help graduates
                to be career-ready. Holistic development at affordable costs will be the aim of the University while
                also ensuring that no student is denied admission due to lack of the ability to pay. The University will
                provide the opportunities of scholarships, freeships and financial assistance for getting loans and
                support from the Delhi government schemes for higher education.
